        <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
        <ul class="lists">
            <li>1 (19 ounce) package Peppercorn & Garlic Seasoned Pork Tenderloin</li>
            <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs)</li>
            <li>â…” cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>10 intact fingers on your hand</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps: </h2>
        <ol class="lists">
            <li>Remove tenderloin from packaging and place on cutting board; cut into 3 equal length sections, each about 3 inches long. Slice each section into 1/4- to 1/2-inch diameter strips. You will end up with approximately 34 strips that are similar in size and shape to French fries. Remember to keep your 10 fingers intact.</li>
            <li>Place eggs, breadcrumbs and flour into separate bowls. Dredge pork strips in flour, coat with beaten egg, and toss in breadcrumbs. Toss in some prayers hoping the whole thing doesn't lights up the sky.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into large skillet until 1/4 inch deep; heat over medium-high until breadcrumb dropped in oil sizzles. Gently place approximately 8 breaded pork strips into oil, making sure not to overcrowd them. Fry approximately 1 1/2 minutes per side until golden brown, crisp, and internal temperature of pork is at least 150 degrees F.; drain on paper towels. Repeat until all pork strips are fried. Note that stove temperature may need to be reduced to prevent burning when the oil level lowers after a few batches. That last part is crucial, because don't want to burn the whole kitchen down trying to fry stuff. Duh.</li>
            <li>Serve with BBQ sauce, sriracha mayonnaise, or ranch dressing for dipping. And if it isn't juicy enough add some chilli sause, only downside is that it'll be coming out like hot lava the whole of next day. Cheers.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Again, reminder to keep your fingers intact!</h4>
